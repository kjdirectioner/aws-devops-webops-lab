# 🧠 Monitoring Setup — Prometheus + Grafana
> Part of the **AWS EC2 + Nginx Automation Series**, extending the setup with monitoring tools (Prometheus & Grafana).

This setup adds **real-time monitoring** to the AWS EC2-based Nginx project using **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.

Prometheus collects system metrics (CPU, memory, disk, network) from **Node Exporter** running on two EC2 instances:
- 🖥️ **Debian EC2** — hosts **Prometheus** and **Grafana**
- 🔗 **Red Hat EC2** — runs **Node Exporter** (remote monitoring target)

---

## ⚙️ Architecture Overview
The following diagram illustrates how the components communicate across two EC2 instances through a private VPC connection.

```
[ Debian EC2 ]  <– Prometheus (9090), Grafana (3000)
│
(VPC Peering)
│
[ Red Hat EC2 ] <– Node Exporter (9100)
```
- **Node Exporter:** Collects host metrics on each instance  
- **Prometheus:** Scrapes metrics from both instances  
- **Grafana:** Visualizes Prometheus data via dashboards  
- **VPC Peering:** Enables secure, private communication between instances

## 🧩 Key Configuration

### 🔹 Prometheus Scrape Targets 
This project uses a minimal version of the default config with a custom node_exporter job added.

📄 Prometheus Config:[prometheus.yml](prometheus.yml)￼— Defines scrape targets for both Node Exporter instances.

**file**(`/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml`)
```yaml
- job_name: "node_exporter"
  scrape_interval: 10s
  static_configs:
    - targets: ["localhost:9100", "<redhat-private-ip>:9100"]
```

### 🔹 Grafana Setup
- Added Prometheus as the data source (`localhost:9090`)
- Imported **Node Exporter Full Dashboard (ID: 1860)**
- Visualized metrics for both EC2 instances

### 🚀 Outcome
✅ Real-time visibility into CPU, memory, disk, and network performance

✅ Cross-VPC monitoring using secure VPC peering

✅ Grafana dashboard with instance-level metric visualization

✅ No public port exposure — accessed via secure SSH tunnel:
```
ssh -L 3000:localhost:3000 ubuntu@<Debian-Public-IP>
```

### 🪜 Next Steps

This project marks the completion of a full monitoring setup using **Prometheus**, **Grafana**, and **Node Exporter** across multiple EC2 instances.

Moving forward, the plan is to continue expanding this architecture by introducing automation, containerization, and scalable cloud-native practices.  
Some of the ideas being explored include:

- Automating monitoring deployment using **Ansible**  
- Defining infrastructure as code with **Terraform**  
- Experimenting with **Docker** for containerized monitoring stacks  
- Setting up **CI/CD pipelines** for continuous deployment  
- Exploring **Kubernetes (EKS)** for scalable orchestration

These improvements will be implemented and documented progressively in future updates.
